## Community Shaders
Merethic ships with a 2nd profile for using Community Shaders but it won't work 100% out of the box. To get this profile fully functional, you need to hide the 2 ENB DLL files in the Stock Game folder. 

Navigate to your Stock Game folder, find `d3d11.dll` and `d3dcompiler_46e.dll` and hide them by copying them to a new folder called `ENB Backup` or something.

After doing this, you can launch the Community Shaders profile as normal.
