# Gameplay

## Getting Started
The easiest way to get started is head to your nearest town or village and take on some basic Missive quests. They don't necessarily pay a massive amount of gold but most of them are simple and don't require diving in dungeons, making them a easy way to earn some starter XP and gold.

You can also speak to people to see if they need help with something.

## Where do I go from there?
You're free to move onto other stuff at any time, though some stuff is time or level locked.

## Quests & Content
I won't spoil all of the quest mods here but I'll detail some of the ones that have prerequisites to starting them.

### The Main Quest
You can start the main quest by going to Helgen, heading inside the inn and speak to innkeeper to stay the night.

### Other Skyrim Quests
Most of the "big" questlines have been expanded and/or overhauled in some way.

### Clockwork
This is level locked to level 10. Isidor will find you when the time is right.

### M'rissi
This is level locked to level 15. You'll find the start on the road West out of Whiterun.

### Belethor's Sister
This is level locked to level 20. Speak to Belethor.

### The Welkynar Knight
This is level locked to level 25. A courier will find you when needed.

### Vicn Mods
All 4 Vicn mods are part of Merethic and are designed to be long term content, pushing towards late game content. Therefore they have specific conditions to start. They are to be played in the order of:
1. DAc0da
2. Vigilant
3. Glenmoril
4. Unslaad

#### DAc0da
To start DAc0da, you must meet the following conditions:
1. Be level 25+
2. Completed The Horn of Jurgen Windcaller
3. Completed The Eye of Magnus
4. Completed Arniel's Endeavour

#### Vigilant
To start Vigilant, you must meet the following conditions:
1. Be level 25+
2. Completed House of Horrors
3. Completed Kindred Judgement (Dawnguard DLC main questline - side does not matter)
4. Completed Unholy Vigil (Vigilant Enforcer CC)
5. Completed Censored Fate (DAc0da - ending does not matter)

#### Glenmoril
To start Glenmoril, you must meet the following conditions:
1. Be level 25+
2. Completed Discerning the Transmundane
3. Completed At the Summit of Apocrypha (finale of the Dragonborn DLC)
4. Completed Act 4 of Vigilant (ending does not matter)

#### Unslaad
To start Unslaad, you must meet the following conditions:
1. Be level 25+
2. Completed Dragonslayer (finale of Skyrim's main quest)
3. Completed Act 4 of Vigilant (Vigilant - ending does not matter, but true ending is recommended)
4. Completed Sacred Anatomancer (Vigilant mod - "divine the future" path is recommended, but any path will do as long as the quest is completed in your journal)

### Other Quests
There are plenty of quests that aren't level locked but they aren't necessarily obvious. You need to talk to people to find out about these things. Here are some hints:
1. The Nightgate Inn can always do with more patronage. I've heard there's some nasty business out on the Western road though.
2. Frissa Black-Briar has been looking for people to do some work.
3. The Bee and Barb inn has some work for people.
4. There are lots of rumours about that the undercroft of the cities in Skyrim are haunted. Wonder if that's true?

## New Lands
There are a few new lands to explore in Merethic.

### Vominheim
I've been told you can only get here from Morrowind provinces.

### Wyrmstooth
These guys have a dragon problem.

### Darkend
There's an artifact in the north of Skyrim that may be of interest.

### Summerset Isle
Only a powerful mage can get here.

## Levelling
Levelling in Merethic is different to vanilla Skyrim in that you don't level a skill by using it. We use static Skill Levelling whereby you get given a certain number of points to distribute across skills every time you level up. The Vokriinator Black perk trees are very large so there will always be something to spend perk points on.

There may also be other methods of gaining insight but these are rare across the world of Tamriel.
