## Enabling Performance LODs
>[!WARNING]
>Only change regular LODs before starting a new save. If you wish to change LODs on an existing save you **must** move into an interior cell, open the DynDOLOD MCM and disable it there and then make a *full save* from the pause menu. Once you've done this, you can then close the game to swap LODs.

1. Scroll down in the left window of MO2 to find the 2 LOD separators.
2. Open the `Performance LODs` separator.
3. Enable both the `Performance TexGen Output` and `Performance DynDOLOD Output` and ensure that they are not being overwritten.
4. Open the `Pretty LODs` separator.
5. Disable both the `Pretty TexGen Output` and `Pretty DynDOLOD Output`.
